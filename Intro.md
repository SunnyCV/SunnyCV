- Hi, I’m @SunnyCV
- I'm interested in learning, which got me interested in everything from history to culture to arts to sciences.
- I’m currently learning how to code and I'm also doing other things on my own along with filmming and editing, screenwriting, and sound producing and designing.
- I’m looking to collaborate on any project where someone may need a designer or editor of sorts. I'm meant for more than just the keyboard.
- You can reach me here personally. I don't like putting my email anywhere in the open, along with personal info. So chat with me here and it'll be cool.
